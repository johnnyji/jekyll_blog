I've by far hated forms that have labels because I think they look tacky and take up extra space for no reason. 

However it's been brought to my attention recently that labels perform VERY important tasks for forms; and that there are reasons why labels should have the same name attribute as their input field counterparts. (No, it's not so that your label will be positioned next to your input field...)

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>Labels will autofocus on the form whent they are clicked on</li>
    <li>Labels will screen read for visually impaired users</li>
    <li>Labels are "preferred" by Google therefore they are BEST included for SEO</li>
  </ol>
