I want to be a programmer! Where do I start, should I get a Computer Science degree?

<blockquote>
You don't need to know Computer Science to be a programmer!

**Uttered every self-taught programmer I've met to date.**

This was a mantra I heavily believed in up until recently. You see, where I work (like many tech companies) there's a healthy mixture of Computer Science grads and self taught coders alike. I recently worked on a module at work where I was paired with a Computer Science co-worker; and by the end, I was convinced just how much knowing Computer Science really does matter.

As a programmer, I feel it's your duty to write code that a perfect marriage between performance and legibility. As a self taught coder, I got the legibility part under the belt. I'm missing the other half of the coin that Computer Science teaches, **performance**.
