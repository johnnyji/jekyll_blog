So today I understood the difference between a 401 and 403 HTTP status code. Which is commonly mistaken for the same response. But here's the distinguishing difference.

<b>HTTP 401 (Unauthorized)

This is the server saying <em>"You are either unauthenticated or authenticated incorrectly"</em>, and therefore access to the content is blocked, until the client is authorized.

 

<b>HTTP 403 (Forbidden)

This is the server saying <em>"I know who you are, you are authenticated, however you don't have the correct permission level to access this content".</em> Such as a user who is authenticated, but trying to access admin content.
