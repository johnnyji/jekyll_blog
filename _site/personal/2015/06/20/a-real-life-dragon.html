  <div class="single-post-content"><p>I’m usually not the type to talk about sentimental things because I think it’s weird; but I’m always up for trying new things, so here goes.</p>

<p>Today, on a sunny Saturday in Vancouver BC, I decided to spend the day at the office working on code. Why? <strike>Because I'm insane</strike> Because I’m fortunate enough to have a passion for what I do and love learning more about it in order to build even more amazing products.</p>

<p>But back to the topic at hand. I decided to go for a run along the seawall to give my mind a break and whom do I by chance run into? This guy:</p>

<p><br />
<strong><em>Mr. Jim Treliving</em></strong>
<img src="/assets/jim.jpg" style="height:300px;display:block;margin:1rem 0;" />
<br /></p>

<p>I was too starstruck in the moment but now that I look back, I’m slowly realizing just how much this run in meant to me.</p>

<p>I don’t read many books but one of my favourites was his book called <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Decisions-Making-Right-Righting-Wrong/dp/1443411817">Decisions</a>. It changed my way of looking at the world, it changed how I make my decisions and most importantly, it changed my approach to life.</p>

<p>Along with many other influencers of mine, Jim is someone who helped me realize that I want to create my own path. He helped me realize that I was not born into this world to just breed and die; but to leave my mark and to change this world in a way that would otherwise be impossible without me.</p>

<p><strong>So here’s a digital toast.</strong> Thank you for your amazing story Jim. Because of you, I dropped out of school and followed my own path. Because of you I decided to take the road less travelled; and because of you, my life will never be the same.</p>
